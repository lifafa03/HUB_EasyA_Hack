# HUB_EasyA_Hack

## Smart Contract Functionality: 
 The smart contract is written in solidity and deployed via the Remix IDE.\
 The smart contract has two main functionalities: **To view the baggage information, and then to update the baggage information**\
 (With more time, functionality would be added that ensures checks that ONLY verified baggage handlers can update baggage information)
 
 Here we have the functions: ``` storeBaggage , updateLocation, getBaggage ,completeBaggage```
